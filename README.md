repFortLauderdale
=================
repFortLauderdale is a web application designed to allow Broward county users to find information on their elected officials. Users can search via address or geolocation. Currently, there is still some information missing for district and city level officials, but that is being worked on. Also, the web app needs optimizations in the javascript files, as well as stricter parameters in the queries made to the Google Civic Information API and the Google Maps API.
