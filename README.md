repFortLauderdale
=================
repFortLauderdale is a web application designed to allow Broward county users to find information on their elected officials. Users can search for their representatives via address or geolocation and get back their name and contact information.

If you'd like more project information, check out [Code For Fort Lauderdale](http://codeforftl.org/) or e-mail [rob at codeforftl.org](mailto:rob@codeforftl.org).

What we're working on now
-------------------------
* Filling in missing information for district- and city-level officials
* Optimizing the web app javascript files
* Creating stricter parameters for app queries to the Google Civic Information and Google Maps APIs
